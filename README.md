# Task List Language

This repository contains Langium grammar for TaskList language implemented in [GLSP blueprints](git@github.com:eclipse-glsp/glsp-examples.git).

The idea is to connect Langium-based LS to GLSP server as [Source Model Server](https://www.eclipse.org/glsp/documentation/integrations/).

## Environment

This project is built under Node v16.13.1.
