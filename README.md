# Task List Language

This repository contains Langium grammar for TaskList language implemented in [GLSP blueprints](https://github.com/eclipse-glsp/glsp-examples/tree/master/project-templates/node-json-theia).

The idea is to connect Langium-based LS to GLSP server as [Source Model Server](https://www.eclipse.org/glsp/documentation/integrations/) into [tasklist-theia-glsp](https://github.com/Crystal-VPL/tasklist-theia-glsp).

## Environment

This project is built with Node v16.20.0.

## Implementation considerations

This language is connected to GLSP through Langium Model Server (LMS) API, so need to identify corresponding graphical and textual elements.
In the example, demoed here [Langium + Sirius Web = Heart](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwjtjeHY1Mz9AhVUlFwKHRICDKQQwqsBegQIFxAE&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dt-BISMWMtwc&usg=AOvVaw2oh1_5SVKkUAzkYOwXrWvU), they used so called "Semantic ID" to locate an element bidirectionally.

That is why, Langium LS enriches AST nodes with semantic *identity*. It is stored in a separate JSON file, and updated on every changes made to the correspondent Langium Document.  
The mapping between AST nodes and their IDs is done either by the `name` of the AstNode (for primary nodes), or by the IDs of the parent/referenced AstNodes (for derivative nodes).  
The `AstNode` mapped to its *identity* is called an `Identified` node.

SourceModel is defined separately from the autogenerated AST (e.g., to have semantic IDs added), and `LangiumModelServerFacade` performs bidirectional mapping. This is done in order not to overload the textual DSL user with irrelevant not language-domain information.

LMS server exposes SourceModel (LMS model) to the outer world (e.g., to be consumed by GLSP server) via an LMS API (see `LangiumModelServerRouter`).

## Thoughts for the future

- Formatter will be needed to apply formatting after making text changes in the source model.
