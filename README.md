# Task List Language

This repository contains Langium grammar for TaskList language implemented in [GLSP blueprints](https://github.com/eclipse-glsp/glsp-examples/tree/master/project-templates/node-json-theia).

The idea is to connect Langium-based LS to GLSP server as [Source Model Server](https://www.eclipse.org/glsp/documentation/integrations/) into [tasklist-theia-glsp](https://github.com/Crystal-VPL/tasklist-theia-glsp).

## Environment

This project is built with Node v16.20.0.

## Implementation considerations

This language is connected to GLSP through Langium Model Server (LMS) API, so need to identify corresponding graphical and textual elements.
In the example, demoed here [Langium + Sirius Web = Heart](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwjtjeHY1Mz9AhVUlFwKHRICDKQQwqsBegQIFxAE&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dt-BISMWMtwc&usg=AOvVaw2oh1_5SVKkUAzkYOwXrWvU), they used so called "Semantic ID" to locate an element bidirectionally.

That is why, Langium LS enriches AST nodes with identifier semanticID. The mapping between the AST nodes and semanticIDs is called **semantic model**. It is stored in a separate file, and updated on every changes made to the correspondent Langium Document.

SourceModel is defined separately from the autogenerated AST (e.g., to have semantic IDs added), and Langium service should do bidirectional mapping. This is done in order not to overload the textual DSL user with irrelevant not language-domain information.

LMS server exposes SourceModel (LMS model) to the outer world (e.g., to be consumed by GLSP server).

## Plans and ideas

Another plan ðŸ“ƒ is to learn how to test Langium-based LS and services

## Thoughts for the future

- Formatter will be needed anyway, though, to serialize AST itself in the formatted manner from the beginning.
- When Langium LS service, responsible for serializing AST back to the source file, saves the file, it should apply formatting on it;
- Since to refer Task, one should specify Task `name`, LS service will probably have to generate Task `name`, when the user creates new task from the diagram view.
